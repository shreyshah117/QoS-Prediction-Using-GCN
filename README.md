# QoS-Prediction-Using-GCN
Creating a Prediction model using GCN, Graph Encoder and Decoder, Graph Transformer. This is the research project that I had done during my 3 months internship at IIIT Guwahati as a Machine Learning Research Intern. PLEASE NOTE - As Model is still under research and currently under evaluation phase , that is why, I am only sharing few code snippets related to it. All other codes are either explained by images or by texts.

<h2>Why this research Project?</h2>
With ever increasing technological innovation in the sector of web services, we need to develop Quality of Service prediction algorithm for recommending services in Real-time. I made this project with the help of deep neural architectures that is GNN. Our model hanldes sparsity of data , finds out non-linear corelation between Users and Services. Our principle focus was that we we obtain higher accuracy and faster prediction time. 

<h2>DataSet:</h2>
We have used WS-Dream dataset.Our dataset consists of Through-Put and Real Time Matrix for each user's services. Datasets also contains user.txt file which have User_Id, Country , Latitude , Longitude, Ip_no , Ip_Address and AS value. Our wslist.txt file contains Service_id , Ip_Address , IP_NO , WSDL_Adress , Latitide, Longitude , AS value.
